# 🌎 Website

My very simple personal website built using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)
as an experiment to learn more about it and hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## 👷🏻‍♂️ Building

    make build

This will build the site and output it to `dist/`.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Running Locally

Run a local server with live rebuilds:

    make run port=8080

This will automatically rebuild when you make changes to files in `src/` and serve the site from `dist/`.

## 🚀 Deploying

Any commit to `main` is automatically deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
