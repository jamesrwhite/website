# 🌎 Website

My very simple personal website built using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) 
as an experiment to learn more about it and hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## 👷🏻‍♂️ Building

    $ make build

This will build the site and output it to `dist/`.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Running Locally

    $ make serve port=8080

This will build the site and serve it from `dist/`.

To continuously build the site when changes are made run:

    $ make watch

## 🚀 Deploying

Any commit to `main` is automatically deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
